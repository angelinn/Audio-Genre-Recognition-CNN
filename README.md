# AudioClassification
## Classifying the genre of an audio file


Main points:
### 1. Take an audio dataset described with its genres
### 2. Build a spectrogram of each 30s cut of the song
### 3. Split that spectrogram to several smaller ones
### 4. Use all the split images to train a convolutional neural network
